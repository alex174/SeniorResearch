<H2>Class Description</H2>
The BFagent--&quot;bitstring forecasting agent&quot; is the centerpiece of 
the ASM model. The agent competes in a stock market, it buy, it 
sells. It decides to buy or sell by making predictions about what the 
price of the stock is likely to do in future. In order to make 
predictions, it keeps a large list of forecast objects on hand, and 
each forecast object makes a price prediction. These forecasts, which 
are created from the BFCast subclass, are fairly sophisticated 
entities, they may monitor many different conditions of the world. 
The forecast which has the best performance record at any given 
instant is used to predict the future price, which in turn leads to 
the buy/sell decision.<P>

Inside the file BFagent.m, there is a long set of comments about the 
updating that went on in the redesign of this code for ASM-2.2. In 
order to faciliate this revision, several new classes were introduced. 
BFParams is an object that keeps values of the parameters for 
BFagents, and BFCast is the forecast object itself. BFCast, in turn, 
keeps its conditions bits with a subclass called BitVector.<P>

If you dig into the code of this agent, you will find a confusing 
thing, so be warned. This code and articles based on it use the term 
&quot;bit&quot; to refer to something that can be valued either 0, 1, or 2. 0 
means &quot;don't care,&quot; 1 means &quot;NO&quot; and 2 means &quot;YES&quot;. The confusing 
thing is that it takes two bits to represent this amount of 
information. In binary, the values would be {00,01,10}, 
respectively. I'm told some people call these trits to keep that in 
mind that two digits are required. As a result of the fact that it 
takes &quot;two bits&quot; to store &quot;one bit's&quot; worth of information, some 
relatively complicated book keeping has to be done. That's where all 
the parameters like &quot;condbits&quot; and &quot;condwors&quot; come into play. In 
ASM-2.0, that book keeping was all &quot;manually done&quot; right here in 
BFagent.m, but in the 2.2 version, it is all hidden in the subclass 
BitVector. So, for purposes of the interface of this class, a bit is 
a 3 valued piece of information, and values of bits inside forecasts 
are set by messages to the forecast, like [aForecast setConditionsbit: 
bit FromZeroTo: 2], for example, will set that bit to 2. If you want 
to know if a forecast has YES or NO for a bit x, [aForecast 
getConditionsbit: x].

		<CODE>- (BitVector *)<B>collectWorldData:</B><EM>aZone</EM>
			
		</CODE><P>
		A forecast has a set of conditions it is watching. These are packed 
tight in a BitVector. We need the world data about the status of those 
conditions packed the same way, in order to make quick checks to find 
out if the world conditions are matched by the BitVector's 
conditions. This method creates a BitVector to match the conditions 
that are being monitored by the agent's forecasts. This requires the 
use of the design assumption that all of an agent's forecasts have the 
same bitlist.

		</CODE><P>
		This is a general utility method for Swarm lists. It removes all 
objects form the &quot;<I>outputList</I>&quot; and copies the elements from <I>list</I> into 
it. It does not actually destroy any elements from either <I>list</I>, it 
just updates references.

of the <B>super</B> class is done.

		Creates a new forecast object (instance of BFCast), with all 
condition bits set to 00 here, meaning &quot;don't care. It also sets 
values for the other coefficients inside the BFCast. This method is 
accessed at several points throughout the BFagent class when new 
forecasts are needed.

		Returns the agent's requested bid (if &gt;0) or offer (if &lt;0) using 
best (or mean) linear forecast chosen by -prepareForTrading. The 
forecast is given by<P>

forecast = pdcoeff*(<I>trialprice</I>+dividend) + offset<P>

where pdcoeff and offset are set by -prepareForTrading.<P>

A risk aversion computation gives a target holding, and its 
derivative (&quot;<I>slope</I>&quot;) with respect to price. The <I>slope</I> is calculated 
as the linear approximated response of a change in price on the 
traders' demand at time t, based on the change in the forecast 
according to the currently active linear rule.

		initForecasts. Creates BFCast objects (forecasts) and puts them 
into an array called fCastList. These are the &quot;meat&quot; of this 
agent's functionality, as they are repeatedly updated, improved, and 
tested in the remainder of the class. Please note each BFagent has 
a copy of the default params object called privateParams. It can be 
used to set individualized values of settings in BFParams for each 
agent. That would allow true diversity! I don't see how that diversity 
would be allowed for in the ASM-2.0.

		Return the last time the Genetic Algorithm was run. 
Agents that don't use a genetic algorithm return MININT. This 
may be used to see if the bit distribution might have changed, 
since a change can only occur through a genetic algorithm.

condition bits that are monitored in the world, or 0 if 
condition bits aren't used.

		</CODE><P>
		Returns the number of forecasts that are used. In the original 
design, this was a constant set in the parameters, although revision 
of the code for ASM-2.2 conceivably should allow agents to alter the 
number of forecasts they maintain.

		Genetic algorithm. It relies on the following separate methods. 
(pj: 2001-11-25. I still see some room for improvement here, but the 
emphasis is to eliminate all global variables and explicitly pass 
return values instead. Any values needed for computations should 
either be passed explicitly or taken from someplace safe)<P>

1. MakePool makes a list of the weakest forecasts: 
rejectList. That is the &quot;npool&quot; weakest rules.<P>

2. &quot;nnew&quot; new rules are created. They are put into a Swarm list 
called newList. Their bit settings are taken from either crossover 
(using tournament selection to get parents), or mutation. 
&quot;Tournament selection&quot; means picking two candidates purely at 
random and then choosing the one with the higher strength. See 
the Crossover and Mutate methods for more details about how they 
work.<P>

3. The nnew new rules replace weakest old ones found in step 
1. This is done by the method &quot;TransferFcastsFrom:To:&quot; It pays no 
attention to strength, but looks at similarity of the bitstrings 
-- rather like tournament selection, we pick two candidates from 
the rejectList at random and choose the one with the MORE similar 
bitstring to be replaced. This maintains more diversity.<P>

4. Generalize looks for rules that haven't been triggered for 
&quot;longtime&quot; and generalizes them by changing a randomly chosen 
fraction &quot;genfrac&quot; of 0/1 bits to &quot;don't care&quot;. It does this 
independently of strength to all rules in the population.<P>

There are several private methods that take care of this 
work. They don't show up in the public interface, but here they 
are:<P>

-(BFCast *) CopyRule:(BFCast *) to From: (BFCast *) from<P>

-(void) MakePool: rejects From: (<B>id</B> &lt;Array&gt;) list<P>

		Take a forecast object and randomly change the bits that govern 
which conditions it monitors. This appears to be a piece of

quite a few of these details floating around in BFagent at one time, 
many are gone now.

		This is the main inner loop over forecasts. Go through the list 
of active forecasts, compare how they did against the world. Notice 
the switch that checks to see how big the bitvector (condwords) is 
before proceeding. At one time, this gave a significant 
speedup. The original sfsm authors say 'Its ugly, but it 
works. Don't mess with it!' (pj: I've messed with it, and don't 
notice much of a speed effect on modern computers with modern 
compilers :&gt; My alternative implementation is commented out inside 
this method)

		Now update the variance and strength of all the forecasts that 
were active in the previous period, since now we know how they 
performed. This method causes an update of price/dividend 
information from the world, then it measures how far off each 
forecast was and puts the square of that &quot;deviance&quot; measure into the 
forecast with the forecast's setVariance: method. Each forecast in 
the active list is told to update its forecast. It also updates the 
instance variable variance, which is calculated here as an 
exponentially weignted moving average of that forecast's 
squared-error (variance). Inside the code of updatePerformance, 
there is a description of the strength formula that is used, and how 
the formula now matches the formula used in the original sfsm, 
rather than ASM-2.0.
