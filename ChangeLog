	* BFagent.m: changed IVAR "p" to "privateParams" to ease editing
	and clarify things.  There is no current purpose in keeping a
	private param object, but at some future time it may be useful,
	especially if there are subclasses from BFagent.
	([BFagent -performGA]): Everything is as local as possible.
	Eliminated all possible global vars.

	* BFagent.m ([BFagent -performGA]): moved GA functions inside
	performGA method, so they have automatic access to Ivars and we no
	longer need to declare all those global variables or functions.  *

	* BFParams.m: new object to old parameters, which were previously
	kept in a struct.

	* BFagent.m: cleared out ^M from Windows
	([BFagent +init]): changed probs and bits from class variables to
	local arrays in this method.  They are only used in this
	method. MAXCONDBITS is a compile-time variable, no need for
	dynamic memory.

	* ASMModelSwarm.m ([ASMModelSwarm +createBegin:]): This is the
	first official entry of the Changelog.  Before Brandon Weber
	released the ASM code, I was working against a copy of the code
	from the SFI's cvs.  There are some slight differences, and
	figuring them out was not too tough.  Anyway, the major idea is to
	get rid of as many "ad hoc" do-it-yourself components, replacing
	them with off-the-shelf Swarm things.  The patch file
	"ASMpatch1-pj.txt" implements the changes that bring the random
	number usage "up to date" with Swarm.
