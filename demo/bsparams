# Bitstring agent parameters for Santa Fe Stockmarket.
# Parameters are recognized solely by position within file -- watch out

# Rule-related parameters
60		# numrules -- number of rules per agent
1		# bidsize -- size of bid or offer
roulette	# selectionmethod -- best or roulette
5		# mincount -- min observations before a rule is used
100.0		# taus -- moving average healing time for rule strengths
50.0		# maxrstrength -- maximum rule strength
0.5		# minrstrength -- minimum rule strength
0.5		# initrstrength	-- initial strength for new rules
0.1		# bitprob -- probability per bit of 0/1 bit initially

# List of bits to be used in condition strings.  Either use "allbits", or
# give a list of bit names terminated by "end".  The available bit names
# are listed in the "names" file.  "null" may be used within the list of
# bits to separate them into groups visually.  You can use "p x" to
# change the bitprob for subsequent bits to "x".

# Examples:
# allbits
# pup pup1 pup2 pup3 pup4 null p 0.0 dup dup1 dup2 dup3 dup4 end

allbits

# GA parameters
400	# gainterval -- average time between GA runs (poisson process)
1000	# firstgatime -- time at which GA is enabled
0.1	# newfrac -- fraction of rules replaced
0.5	# pcrossover -- probability of crossover
0.01	# pmutation -- mutation rate per bit
0.5	# preverse -- probability of reversal for weak rules
2000	# longtime -- generalise if rule unused for this length of time
0.25	# genfrac -- fraction of 0/1 bits to make don't-care when generalising
