# Bitstring agent parameters for Santa Fe Stockmarket.
# Parameters are recognized solely by position within file -- watch out

# Rule-related parameters
60	# numrules -- number of rules per agent
1	# bidsize -- size of bid or offer
100.0	# taus -- moving average healing time for rule strengths
50.0	# maxrstrength -- maximum rule strength (25)
0.5	# minrstrength -- minimum rule strength
0.5	# initrstrength	-- initial strength for new rules
0.1	# bitprob -- probability per bit of 0/1 bit initially

# List of bits to be used in condition strings.  Either use "all", or give
# a list of bit names terminated by "end".  The available bit names are
# listed in the BITNAMES file.  "null" may be used within the list of
# bits to separate them into groups visually.  You can use "p x" to
# change the bitprob for subsequent bits to "x".

# Examples:
# all
# pup pup1 pup2 pup3 pup4 null p 0.0 dup dup1 dup2 dup3 dup4 end

# GA parameters
400	# gafrequency -- average time between GA runs (poisson process)
1000	# firstgatime -- time at which GA is enabled
0.2	# poolfrac -- fraction of rules chosen for possible replacement
0.1	# newfrac -- fraction of rules actually replaced
0.5	# pcrossover -- probability of crossover
0.01	# pmutation -- mutation rate per bit
0.5	# preverse -- probability of reversal for weak rules
2000	# longtime -- generalise if rule unused for this length of time
0.25	# genfrac -- fraction of 0/1 bits to make don't-care when generalising
