# Event schedule for the Santa Fe Stockmarket.
#
# This file specifies when various events happen.  The possible events
# include everything that the front end can do that affects the outcome
# of the simulation, so that runs (even with user intervention) can be
# reproduced exactly.  The front end writes out new events to the logfile
# as they occur.  The logfile itself can be used as a startup file to
# reproduce the run.
#
# For output events, appropriate output files must also be specified (in the
# main control file), or these requests will be ignored.
#
# Each line is of one of the forms:
#    t action [params]		Event at time t
#    t1 t2 action [params]	Event at time t1, t1+1, t1+2, ... t2
#    t1 t2 dt action [params]	Event at time t1, t1+dt, t1+2*dt, ... t2
# where "action" specifies a type of event and "params" is a parameter
# string that specifies further details for some types of actions.
#
# The actions and parameters are:
#    a			write agent information to agent file
#    d			display on screen [ignored in batch version]
#    dividend ...	reset a dividend parameter (see Dividend.m)
#    D n		disable agent n
#    debug		check various things if debugging flags are set
#    e			evolve agent population
#    enable ...		same as E ...
#    E n  		enable agent n
#    E all		enable all agents
