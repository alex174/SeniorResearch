# List of agents for the Santa Fe Stockmarket.
#
# This file specifies which agents are participating in the market.
# Each line should have four fields, separated by spaces or tabs:
#
#   Agent_class      Number     Initial_holding	   Parameter_filename

# The possible Agent_class values are listed in the following table.
# Either the long name (e.g. "Bitstring") or the two-letter code (e.g. "BS")
# may be used in this file.  Some Parameter_filename values are also given
# in parentheses (e.g. bsparams); these template files contain explanations
# of the parameters for each agent.
#
# Bitstring	BS	Buy-sell classifiers with a genetic algorithm.  More
#			or less as in the Physica paper, except that the
#			condition bits may be selected initially.  (bsparams)
#
# Bitforecast	BF	Multiple linear forecasters per agent with condition
#			bits; statistically weighted; genetic algorithm;
#			risk aversion as basis for bids.  (bfparams)
#
# Linear	LI	Simple fixed linear forecasters (5 per agent); risk
#			aversion.  (fparams)
#
# Dumb		DU	Dumb agent; buys or sells based on one bit.  (duparams)

# You can have multiple "types" of agents in the same class, by specifying
# several lines with the same Agent-class but different Parameter-filenames.

# The Initial_holding values should normally be 1.0.

# Example entries:
#BF		10	1.0	bfparams
#BF		10	1.0	bfparams2
#Bitstring	20	1.0	bsparams
#DU		10	1.0	duparams
#LI		10	1.0	fparams

# Actual entries
BF		50	1.0	bfparams
