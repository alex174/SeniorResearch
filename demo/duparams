# Dumb agent (DU) parameters for Santa Fe Stockmarket.
# Parameters are recognized solely by position within file -- watch out

# This agent has only 2 parameters; how large a bid or offer to make (bidsize)
# and which of the world bits to use (keybit).  If the key bit is on then
# the bid is bidsize; if it is off the bid is -bidsize.  A negative bid
# is an offer.  bidsize itself may negative.  The actual bid or offer is
# also limited by the mincash and minholding constraints.

# The bit names that can be used for the "keybit" parameter are listed in the
# "names" file.  Note that using "random" for the keybit gives a simple
# noise trader.
