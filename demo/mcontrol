# General control parameters for the Santa Fe Stock Market
# Parameters are recognized solely by position within file -- watch out!

# Unless specified on the command line, this control file itself is normally
# looked for first in the current working directory and then in the directory
# where the program resides.
#
# Under NeXTSTEP, the current working directory is the user's home directory
# if the program is launched from the Workspace Manager, and the "directory
# where the program resides" is taken to mean either outside or inside the
# application's file package (normally Market.app).
#
# Debugging flags
# ---------------
# These can be specified here, or on the command line with a -dxxx option,
# where xxx is a string of desired flags.  The union (OR) of the two
# specifications is used.  Use "0" here if no flags are specified.
# The flags are:
#   a	Debug agents (depends on individual agent classes)
#   b	Debug agent browser; report fixable inconsistencies
#   c	Show CPU time at certain times
#   d	Debug dividend process -- show some internal parameters
#   e	Show each event returned (except display events)
#   f	Show filenames and path computations (-df *option* shows more)
#   h	Debug holding; check conservation of the total
#   n	Debug NameTree, show number of nodes in use
#   o   Debug Output
#   t	Debug types and classes -- checks lists, reports summary
#   w	Debug world; check moving averages and record-keeping
#   A	Turn on ALL of the the above flags
#   0	No effect; use if no other flags are specified
0	# debugflags

# Random number seed for market and agents
# ----------------------------------------
# Use a positive integer for reproducible results, or 0 to choose randomly,
# or -1 to chain from the previous run.  Note that the dividend process
# has a separate seed, specified in the dparams file.  The log file always
# shows the value to use to reproduce the run.
0	# mseed

# Filenames
# ---------
# Unless filenames start with / or ~/ they are taken to be relative to the
# directory in which this control file was found.  Absolute and relative
# pathnames are fully implemented for Unix, but only partially for MSDOS
# or Windows (use \ for separators, but no drive letters), and not at all
# for VMS.
#
# Surround the whole filename in double quotes if it includes spaces or #'s.
#
# "-" may be used to specify stdin or stdout.
#
# "=" may be used for input files to mean the same file as before so, for
# example, specifying "=" for the dparamfilename would mean that the
# dividend parameters would be read from this file, following the control
# parameters.  This allows concatenation of all the input files into a
# single file, in the order listed here.  The log file produced by a run
# is just such a file, and may be used as a single input file (in place of
# this one) to reproduce that run exactly.
#
# Other input files may be needed for specific agents.  These are
# specified in the agentlist file, and follow the same naming
# conventions as those here.  They are read after the agentlist file
# and before the timelist file, in order of the agent specifications.
# If "=" is used for the timelist file, it means the same file as the
# agentlist file, which is not necessarily the same as the last such
# agent-specific file.
#
#  "=" may also be used for the output streams (except the first), thus
# merging their output.
#
# "<none>" may be used for output files to turn off their output.
#
# Output filenames may contain one or more #'s, which are replaced by digits
# of the run number, from right to left.  In this case the filename MUST
# be enclosed in double quotes.  Output filenames may also be prefixed
# by a "+" to imply append-mode (append to an existing file) and/or by
# a "*" to suppress the normal heading block at the start of the output.

#Input files
# -----------
dparams		# dparamfilename -- parameters for dividend process
mparams		# mparamfilename -- parameters for market & specialist
agntlist	# agentlistfilename -- list of agents in market
output		# outputfilename -- specifications
timelist	# timefilename -- list of times to produce output or display

# Log file
# --------
"log###"	# logfilename -- log of parameters
