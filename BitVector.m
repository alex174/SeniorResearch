@implementation BitVector
/*" This class is the "hairy guts" that makes bit forecasts possible.

A bit vector is a group of "words", and each "word" contains 16
indicators.  In this model, the bit vectors have 5 words, which means
there are 80 indicators possible.

In the substance of this model, a "bit" is an aspect of the world
being monitored.  In genetic algorithm terms, one can say "NO", "YES"
or "don't care", for each piece of information. A bit has values in
integer format of 0, 1, or 2. But in binary, that is 00, 01, and 10,
and in this class those binary representations are clumped together to
be represented by a 32 bit integer, as in

0110001000011000010101100100100101010101

which holds the status of 16 bits.  There can be as many as 5 of these
in a BitVector.  Those words are referred to by the pointer
"conditions".  The first word can be found at conditions[0], the
second at conditions[1], and so forth.  Note that these are integer
values, but the bit math does work on the binary values.  I probably
need a computer scientist to translate this for me...

The world in the ASM can give a vector as well, telling us in binary
many indicators, whether they are good or bad, 0 or 1.  So the bit
forecasting agent takes the 0's and 1's from the world, and checks to
see if they are used in the forecast, and makes a forecast.  All of
the checking and setting of forecast bits is handled by this BitVector
class.

I suppose, if you are like me and don't like bit math, this is all
confusing and you don't care, in which case you can readily ignore the
details and just proceed to set the values of bits according to the
interface below. Its pretty obvious.

But if you want details, here is a very telling piece of documentation
that goes with the function "makebittables", which used to be at the
top of BFagent, but now its here, hidden in the dark and not so scary
to users:

 *
 * Construct tables for fast bit packing and condition checking for
 * classifier systems.  Assumes 32 bit words, and storage of 16 ternary
 * values (0, 1, or *) per word, with one of the following codings:
 * Value       Message-board coding         Rule coding

 *   0			2			1
 *   1			1			2
 *   *			-			0
 
* Thus rule satisfaction can be checked with a simple AND between
 * the two types of codings.
 *
 * Sets up the tables to store MAXCONDBITS ternary values in
 * CONDWORDS = ceiling(MAXCONDBITS/16) words.
 *
 * After calling this routine, given an array declared as
 *		int array[CONDWORDS];
 * you can do the following:
 *
 * a. Store "value" (0, 1, 2, using one of the codings above) for bit n with
 *	array[WORD(n)] |= value << SHIFT[n];
 *    if the stored value was previously 0; or
 * 
 * b. Store "value" (0, 1, 2, using one of the codings above) for bit n with
 *	array[WORD(n)] = (array[WORD(n)] & NMASK[n]) | (value << SHIFT[n]);
 *    if the initial state is unknown.
 *
 * c. Store value 0 for bit n with
 *	array[WORD(n)] &= NMASK[n];
 * 
 * d. Extract the value of bit n (0, 1, 2, or possibly 3) with
 *	value = (array[WORD(n)] >> SHIFT[n]) & 3;
 *
 * e. Test for value 0 for bit n with
 *	if ((array[WORD(n)] & MASK[n]) == 0) ...
 *
 * f. Check whether a condition is fulfilled (using the two codings) with
 *	for (i=0; i<CONDWORDS; i++)
 *	    if (condition[i] & array[i]) break;
 *	if (i != CONDWORDS) ...
 *
