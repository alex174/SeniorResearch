/**
 * DateTitle (an extension of TextTitle) is a simple convenience class to easily add the text of
 * the date to a chart.  Keep in mind that a chart can have several titles, and that they can
 * appear at the top, left, right or bottom of the chart - a DateTitle will commonly appear at
 * the bottom of a chart (although you can place it anywhere).
 * <P>
 * By specifying the locale, dates are formatted to the correct standard for the given Locale.
 * For example, a date would appear as "January 17, 2000" in the US, but "17 January 2000" in
 * most European locales.
