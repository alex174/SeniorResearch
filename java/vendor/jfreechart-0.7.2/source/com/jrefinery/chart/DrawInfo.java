/**
 * A structure for storing rendering information from one call to the JFreeChart.draw(...)
 * method.
 * <P>
 * An instance of the JFreeChart class can draw itself within an arbitrary rectangle on any
 * Graphics2D.  It is assumed that client code will sometimes render the same chart in more
 * than one view, so the JFreeChart instance does not retain any information about its
 * rendered dimensions.  This information can be useful sometimes, so you have the option to
 * collect the information at each call to JFreeChart.draw(...), by passing an instance of
 * this DrawInfo class.
