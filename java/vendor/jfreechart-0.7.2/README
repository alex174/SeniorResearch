1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
JFreeChart is an open-source Java class library for producing charts.
It runs on the Java 2 Platform (JDK1.3 or later) and uses the Java
2D API for drawing.

JFreeChart is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).  A copy of the licence is
included in the download.

Please note that JFreeChart is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;

If you have an comments, suggestions or bugs to report, please post a
message in the JFreeChart discussion forum.

-----------------
3.  DEPENDENCIES
-----------------
JFreeChart requires JDK 1.3 or later.  In addition, it uses classes
from the JCommon class library (also available from
www.jrefinery.com), version 0.5.4 or later.  The JCommon jar file is
included in the JFreeChart download, but you may want to download
JCommon separately to obtain the full source code (also under the GNU
Lesser General Public Licence).

------------------------
4. THE DEMO APPLICATION
------------------------
There is a demonstration application included with JFreeChart.  To run
it you need the two files jfreechart-0.7.2.jar and jcommon-0.5.4.jar.
Using JDK 1.3 (or later) you can start the demo by running the class:

    com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo.

For example, on Linux, the following command line will run the demo
application:

java -classpath jcommon-0.5.4.jar:jfreechart-0.7.2.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo

Depending on your system configuration and the current working
directory, you may need to specify paths in the above command line.  

If you are using Windows, please note that the entries on the class
path should be separated with a semi-colon rather than a colon.

5.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.7.2 : (8-Feb-2002) Integrated the WindPlot code from Achilleus
        Mantzios. Added an optional background image for the
        JFreeChart class, and another optional background image for
        the Plot class.  Added alpha-transparency for the plot
        foreground and background.  Added new pie chart label types
        that show values.  Fixed a bug with the legend that results in
        a loop at small chart sizes. Added some tooltip methods that
        were missing from the previous version. Changed the Insets
        class on chart titles to a new Spacer class that will allow
        for relative or absolute insets (the plan is to eventually
        replace all Insets in the JFreeChart classes).  Fixed a bug in
        the setAutoRangeIncludesZero method of the NumberAxis class.
        Added the instructions that were missing from the copies of
        the GNU Lesser General Public Licence included with JFreeChart.

0.7.1 : (25-Jan-2002) Added tooltips, crosshairs and zooming
        functions, thanks to Jonathan Nash and Hans-Jurgen Greiner
        for contributing the code that these features are based on.
        Moved the combination charts into the package
        com.jrefinery.chart.combination, made a number of other small
        API changes and fixed some bugs.  Removed the Javadoc HTML
        from the download to save space (you can regenerate it from
        the source code if you need it).

0.7.0 : (11-Dec-2001) New combination plots developed by Bill
        Kelemen.  Added Wolfgang Irler's servlet demo to the standard
        download.  The About window in the demo application now
        includes a list of developers that have contributed to the
        project.

0.6.0 : (27-Nov-2001) New plots including scatter plot, stacked bar
        charts and 3D bar charts.  Improved pie chart.  Data
        interfaces and classes moved to the JCommon class library.
        New properties to control spacing on bar charts.  New
        auto-tick mechanism.  JFreeChartPanel now incorporates
        buffering, and popup menu.  Javadocs revised.  Fixed numerous
        bugs from version 0.5.6.  Demo application updated.
