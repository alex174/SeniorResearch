Others (Jose Manueal Galán and Luis R. Izquierdo) ported SFI-ASM to java. Their code, in the latest version available from sourceforce, is avaiable here.

About two weeks ago, Jose and Luis announced they had
completed work on a Java version of the ASM.  They
forwarded the files to me and now I'm posting them
to share with you.  From a couple of their notes
I have assembled this information:

Jose Manuel Galán  <redacted email>

As the final year project for our degree (University of Valladolid, Spain), 
we replicated the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market (ASM 2.2) 
in Java with Swarm. We finished it some months ago, but we 
have been working in other multiagent-models since then.

The source code of this work is available for everybody 
who might want it (we can send it to the Swarm Development 
Group to be revised if you like). The documentation of 
the program is also available, though it is in Spanish.

We would also like to acknowledge the help of Blake 
LeBaron and Paul Johnson, and very specially the help 
of Marcus G. Daniels, because he gave us a light to continue our work.

There is only a small clarification: to show the wealth and 
position windows we have used the jFreeChart 0.7.2 libraries 
(http://www.object-refinery.com/jfreechart/index.html) because 
when we did this project I remember there were problems with 
histogram class of Swarm but the program works.


We include
          1.  the source code
          2. A UML description of the java files
          3.  jfreechart-0.7.2, necessary libraries to run the model
          4.  Documentation of the model, the javadoc of the model
explaining all the variables of methods (sorry, but this is in spanish)

Of course if you find any problem with it, write us.
Comment us.
