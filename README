SASM.  Social ASM notes.

SASM is a new development path for new ideas about the Santa Fe Artificial
Stock Market.

We began with  ASM-2.4, which is the "finalized" 
Swarm version of the artificial stock market as presented by Arthur, LeBaron, Palmer, 
Holland.  To the best of our knowledge, ASM-2.4 is a fully functional program
which reproduces the dynamics of the Next Objective-C models that are discussed
in the published articles.

All changes in content and functionality after that are introduced solely for
our interests and research purposes, and the original ASM team has no responsibility
whatsoever for any mistakes or problems that we may introduce.
